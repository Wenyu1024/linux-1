# How We Teach

This course is new territory for us, as this used to be a course that was taught at our premisses with direct interaction. We think that we now split instructions and interactivity by the following concept:

- We mainly provide shorter videos and supporting slides to explain a certain topic, which should be able to be followed on ones own computer
- We present short, simple exercises that should be solvable with the input from the video sessions
- It is no problem if an exercise remains unsolved, as long as you confront yourself with the problem and discuss it the next morning
- In case of issues, we have a online discussion session the following morning to elaborate
- The daily time spent with the course should not exceed 90 minutes, mounting up to about 10 hours in total (including the preparation steps)
- Please, provide instant feedback if you feel that something is not working out (we will provide the means for doing so)


# Practicalities 

- In the online sessions, please keep your video on (if bandwidth permits) and indicate a question by raising your hand
- If there are strong background noises, please mute your microphone when you do not actively speak
- If you for some reason cannot attend the online session, please notify us (best beforehand)
- The timeframe for the online sessions is a suggestion, if we are done earlier, we do not have to do a full hour
